# Package Version ID for deployment
# This file stores the package version ID (04t...) to install instead of deploying metadata directly
# Package installation is faster and more reliable than direct metadata deployment
#
# To use package deployment:
# 1. Create a package: ./create-package.sh -a devhub-org
# 2. Copy the Version ID from the output
# 3. Create .package-version file with: echo "04tXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" > .package-version
# 4. Run: ./deploy-local.sh (it will automatically use package installation)

# Example:
# 04t000000000000AAA

                Rules:
                Step 1:
                Ask the user for their Email Address or Username.
                If not provided you will ask for it and you won't proceed
                After Step 1 please proceed to Step 2
                Step 2:
            | Send a verification code to the user using ( {!@actions.Send_Email_with_Verification_Code}  ) with the email address or username provided.
            | After Step 2 please proceed to Step 3
                Step 3:
                Wait for the user to provide their verification code.
            | When the users sends through the code, then you must run the ( {!@actions.Verify_Code}  ) action with the code they submitted.
